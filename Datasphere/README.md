# **Description**

The SAP Federated ML Python libraries (FedML) applies the Data Federation architecture of SAP Datasphere for intelligently sourcing SAP as well as non-SAP data for Machine Learning experiments done <b>at any Machine Learning platform</b> thereby removing the need for replicating or moving data. By abstracting the Data Connection and  Data load , the FedML library provides end to end platform agnostic integration support for instant data access & discovery of semantically rich business data with just few lines of code. 

# **What's new**

<ul>
  <li>Platform Independency -  FedML can be used on any (non-hyperscaler) Machine learning platform.
  <li>GPU support  - We now support NVIDIA RAPIDSâ„¢ framework and CUDA cuDF and cuML.
  <li>SAP AI Core Deployment Support  - Models that are trained in any ML Platform can now be deployed in SAP GenAI Hub's AI Core. 
  <li>Core connectivity now supports sourcing data from SAP Datapshere models directly into PySpark and cuPy (for GPU) dataframes.
 </ul>
